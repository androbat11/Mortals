## Project Structure

The app lives in `web/` and follows atomic design with functional components only:

- `web/src/components/atoms/`: smallest building blocks (buttons, labels).
- `web/src/components/molecules/`: small groups of atoms.
- `web/src/components/organisms/`: larger self-contained sections.
- `web/src/components/templates/`: page layouts without real content.
- `web/src/pages/`: full screens that fill templates with content.
